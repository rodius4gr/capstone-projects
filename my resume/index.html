            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Stelios Karagiannidis</strong>, and I have been working in the
                law enforcement sector since 2002, after graduating from the Hellenic Police Academy.
                In 2020, I earned my <strong>BSc in Computer Science</strong> from the
                Hellenic Open University (HOU), and I am now building my career as a
                <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently focused on learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>,
                with upcoming goals to expand into <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
                Between 2020 and 2024, I also worked on <strong>gaming-related projects</strong>,
                managing small developer teams and improving user experience through technical updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy combining discipline, problem-solving, and creativity — skills I’ve developed
                through both my professional experience and my studies in technology.
            </p>
